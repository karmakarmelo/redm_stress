# Stress system
This is a simple stress system for RedM RP, you get stress walking, running, swimming, shooting and when you get damaged, there are also 
relax zones

You can change the relax zones in lines 92 and 105 in the client side
You can also change the stress animation on line 81 on the client side

### This script is fully editable and I plan to improve it in the future.

This script may experience several failures, if so I would appreciate it if you would let me know
